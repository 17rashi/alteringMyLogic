2. There are 2 jugs with 4 litres and 5 litres of water respectively. 
The objective is to pour exactly 7 litres of water in a bucket. 
How can it be accomplished?

Answer: Following steps should follow: bucket, 5 litres-A, 4 litres-B.
1. Transfer 4 litres in bucket.
2. Transfer 4 litres in B.
3. Move that 4 litres in bucket.
4. Move 1 litres from bucket A to B.
5. Move 5 litres from bucket to A.
6. Move 3 litres to B and now B has 4 litres and bucket has 3 litres, so mix them in Bucket and now bucket has 7 litres.


## Day-3

a bulb in the next room. You can’t see whether the bulb is on or off, until you leave the room.

## Day-4

1. Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, 
they have only one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without one. 
The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take 
the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins.

Answer: 17 mins, 1+2+2+10+2=17

2. There are 12 identical-looking coins. One of these coins is counterfeit 
and is known to be lighter than the genuine coins. What is the minimum number of
weighings needed to identify the fake coin with a two-pan balance scale without weights?

Answer: 3 , First we divide the coins in 6-6 pairs the we find out the weight. We will take the 
lighter weight and then again repeat the same process. At the end we will get 3 coins and we find weight of two. 
If weight is equal then the third one is lighter one else one of them was lighter.

## Day-5

1. There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will break. 
If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. Find N, while minimizing 
the number of drops for the worst case.
Note: These are very strong eggs because they can be dropped multiple times without breaking as long as 
they are dropped from floors below their “threshold” floor, floor N. But once an egg is dropped from a 
floor above it’s threshold floor, it will break. Find the minimum number of drops required to figure out N.

Answer: 14

2. A man (X) bought a product worth Rs 100 from the Shopkeeper (Y). He paid him through a 500 Rs Note.

First: “wonderful! my oldest is the same age!”How old are the daughters?

How old are the daughters ?

Answer: 3 3 8
72,1,1 - sum = 74
36,2,1 - sum = 39
18,2,2 - sum = 22
18,4,1 - sum = 23
9,8,1  - sum = 18
9,4,2  - sum = 15
8,3,3  - sum = 14
6,6,2  - sum = 14
